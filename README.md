Simons Game Instructions:

Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "BUZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
